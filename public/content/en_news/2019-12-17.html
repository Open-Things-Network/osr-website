        On this day, the Open Things Network Association was entered into the register of ordinary associations kept by 
        the Mayor of Bydgoszcz. However, the idea of establishing an association appeared much earlier.<br>
        On January 5, 2019, the first meeting took place in Bydgoszcz, which was attended by the initiators and activists 
        of several Polish TTN communities as well as representatives of local universities and companies. During this meeting, 
        the decision was made to establish a nonprofit organization and for the first time its goals and tasks were presented.
        Thank you to everyone who took part in this important meeting for the Association.
