    Version 1.1 of our LoRa development board had its official premiere on June 21 during 
    <a href="http://www.inzynierdomu.pl/arduino-raspberry-pi-day-2020/" target="_blank">Arduino & Raspberry Pi Day 2020</a>.

    The printed circuit board, whose authors are members of our association, offers a lot of configuration options, 
    such as the choice of a transceiver module (RFM95W, RN2483A), or the use of various power methods (USB, battery, solar panel).

    The circuit board design with full documentation and sample programs is available for download from 
    <a href="https://github.com/Open-Things-Network/lora-dev-board" target="_blank"> GitHub repository</a>.
