        We are preparing a cheap and versatile hardware platform that will be used during the future workshops related 
        to LoRaWAN technology. <br>
        The circuit board we designed will allow easy integration of Arduino Pro Mini with popular RFM95W or RN2483A modules. 
        Thanks to derived interfaces and signals, it will be possible to connect sensors, as well as the use of various 
        power sources.<br>
        The platform prepared in this way will enable the implementation of end device in many ways. We hope that the board 
        will be an ideal tool for prototyping both for those who are starting their adventure with LoRaWAN technology and 
        for those more advanced.<br>

        At the beginning we ordered 30 printed circuit boards. 20 sets in various configurations will be devoted to workshops.

    <p>
        Each member of our association will receive a printed circuit board that they can prepare at their own discretion and 
        use to implement their own projects.
