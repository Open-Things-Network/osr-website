        We see the huge potential of the Internet of Things and we want Poland, including local communities, 
        to be able to use this potential.
    </p>
    <p> 
        We believe that easy access to the Internet of Things infrastructure, which does not require license 
        and subscription fees, can be a crucial factor supporting communities, scientific institutions and 
        startups, helping them compete in the modern market.
    </p>
    <p>
        We think that creating the open infrastructure can be a catalyst for new ideas (both open and commercial) 
        for applying the idea of the Internet of Things in various areas.
    </p>
    <p>
        We believe that, as a consequence, new initiatives and ideas will have a positive impact on the quality 
        of life, safety and health of the community and individuals.
