    <p>
        We notice the enormous potential of the Internet of the Things and we want Poland
        and the local communities could also exploit this potential.
    </p>
    <p>
        We think, that simple access to infrastructure for the Internet of the Things
        which doesn't require royalties and licence can be a crucial factor supporting communities,
        research institutions and startupy, helping them to compete on the contemporary market.
    </p>
    <p>
        We think that creating the open infrastructure can act as a catalyst for new ideas
        (both opened and commercial) for applying the idea of the Internet of Things in various areas.
    </p>
    <p>
        We believe that in consequence new initiatives and ideas will be having a positive effect on a quality of life,
        a safety and a health of the community and individual person.
