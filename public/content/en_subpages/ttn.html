    <h3 class="page__main__title">What is The Things Network?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The Things Network is a project initiated in 2015 in Amsterdam. Its aim is building a global network for the 
        Internet of Things using LoRaWAN technology, which is characterized by low energy consumption, long range and 
        low bandwidth, so it is ideal for IoT solutions. LoRaWAN technology has gained a great popularity due to the 
        possibility of easy and relatively cheap creation of a network for battery-operated devices. 
        The Things Network project has made this even easier by providing an open network infrastructure - just set up 
        the gateways and focus on the end nodes and applications. The network began to grow very quickly and is already 
        being developed in over 100 countries around the world. Also in Poland, local communities have been created since 
        2016 to gather enthusiasts interested in network development - mainly in large cities.
        </br></br>
        TTN network is open, distributed, decentralized, free of charge, based on an open software stack and is owned by 
        the community that creates it. 
        </br></br>
        Open means that everyone has access to it and can contribute to its development. Anyone can increase the network 
        coverage by installing and starting another gateway. The network infrastructure is therefore developed and maintained 
        by its users. The network is distributed because the basic components of the network backend can be run in any domain. 
        Sustainable because it maintains a balance between the number of users using the network and contributing resources to 
        it, and decentralized because it means involving as many parties as possible cooperating with each other to operate 
        and develop the network.

    <h3 class="page__main__title">TTN communities</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Local TTN communities are groups of people from a specific area (mainly cities) who deal with the implementation 
        of The Things Network by building the LoRaWAN network, promoting the idea of an open network, acquiring partners 
        and locations for gateway installation, organizing workshops and meetings. Communities consist of many people, 
        organizations and interest groups. They include technology enthusiasts, representatives of companies and academic circles. 
        </br></br>
        Polish communities involved in The Things Network are part of the global TTN community and operate in accordance with 
        the principles set out in <u><a href="https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/Manifesto">TTN Manifesto</a></u>.
        </br></br>
        In 2018, a group of enthusiasts from several TTN communities (Bydgoszcz, Łódź, Ostrów Wielkopolski and Toruń)
        set themselves the goal of strengthening interest in developing the concept of an open network based on TTN, 
        improving the reach of this network and creating a non-profit organization that would support Polish TTN community 
        and has undertaken cooperation activities to build, maintain and promote an open LoRaWAN network.

    <h3 class="page__main__title">Association</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The Open Things Network Association was established in December 2019.
        </br></br>
        The organization is to be a tool supporting and integrating local TTN communities, and not something that will replace them.
        </br></br>
        We want to represent local communities and support them in achieving a common goal, as well as improve communication 
        between community members. The creation of the association will allow us to talk more easily and effectively with company 
        representatives and institutions, raise funds for achieving goals, and better advertise our ideas and more effectively 
        reach interested persons. 
        <br><br>
        The use of the TTN network, its potential and knowledge as well as cooperation and support of the TTN community is currently 
        the best way to achieve the Association's goals. For this reason, we treat this project as a priority.
