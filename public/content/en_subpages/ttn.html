    <h3 class="page__main__title">What is The Things Network?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The Things Network is a project initiated in 2015 in Amsterdam. Its aim is
        building a global network for the Internet Things using LoRaWAN technology, which is characterized by low
        energy consumption, long range and low bandwidth - so it is ideal for Internet solutions
        Things. The LoRaWAN technology has gained great popularity due to the possibility of easy and relatively cheap
        to create a network for battery-operated devices.
        The Things Network project has made this even easier by providing an open network infrastructure - just
        set up the gates and focus on your terminal equipment and applications. The network began to grow
        very quickly and is already being developed in over 100 countries around the world. Also in Poland, since 2016
        local communities gathering enthusiasts interested in network development - mainly in large cities.
        </br></br>
        The TTN network is open, distributed, decentralised, free of charge, based on an open stack
        The software and is owned by the community that creates it.
        </br></br>
        Open means that everyone has access to it and can contribute to its development. Everyone
        can increase the range of the network by installing and starting another gateway. The network infrastructure is
        therefore
        developed and maintained by its users.
        The network is distributed because the basic components of the network backend can be run in any domain.
        Balanced because it maintains a balance between the number of users using the network and contributing to
        her resources,
        and decentralised as it involves as many parties working together as possible to
        the operation and development of the network.

    <h3 class="page__main__title">TTN communities</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Local TTN communities are groups of people from a specific area (mainly cities) who occupy
        The Things Network is implemented by building the LoRaWAN network, promoting the idea of an open network,
        acquiring
        partners and locations for the installation of gates, organization of workshops and meetings.
        Communities consist of many people, organizations and interest groups. They include technology enthusiasts,
        representatives of companies and the academic community.
        </br></br>
        Polish communities involved in The Things Network are part of the global TTN community and operate within the
        It is defined according to the rules defined in <u><a
                href="https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/Manifesto">Manifesto
                TTN</a></u>.
        </br></br>
        In 2018, a group of enthusiasts from several TTN communities (Bydgoszcz, Łódź, Ostrów Wielkopolski and Toruń)
        set up
        aim to strengthen interest in the development of an open network concept based on TTN, to improve coverage
        of this network and to create a non-profit organization that would support the Polish TTN communities and
        undertake
        cooperation activities to build, maintain and promote an open LoRaWAN network.

    <h3 class="page__main__title">Association</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The Open Things Network Association was established in December 2019.
        </br></br>
        The organisation is to be a tool to support and integrate local TTN communities, not something to replace them.
        </br></br>
        We want to represent local communities and support them in achieving a common goal,
        and to improve communication between members of the community.
        The creation of the association will allow us to talk more easily and effectively with company representatives
        and
        institutions, raise funds to achieve the objectives,
        and better publicise our ideas and reach out more effectively to interested people.
        <br><br>
        The use of the TTN network, its potential and knowledge and the cooperation and support of the TTN community is
        currently
        the best way to achieve the goals of the Association. For this reason, we give priority to this project.
